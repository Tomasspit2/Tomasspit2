- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomas Spit.
  A little bit on myself:
  After working 8 years as a baker, i decided to make a big change and do a formation in web devellopment (with a specialisation in PHP and Symfony).
  During this bootcamp i learned to extend to create full web applications, using FIGMA for the graphic charts, the wireframes, PHPstorm as IDE and
  HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and Symfony for the construction of the full application. Certain projects that you will find here are build in PHP native, some without PHP (pure CSS HTML)
  and others will have Symfony integrated. I finish my courses in the end of July, gaining the diplome Full Stack Web Develloper (BAC+2).
  Do not hesitate to send me any questions regarding the projects you will find, or any personal questions.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in finding a job as a backend developper, using mainly PHP (8.2) and Symfony (6.3.)
